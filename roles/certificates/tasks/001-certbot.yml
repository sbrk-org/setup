# This is a bit weird:
#
# - certbot needs nginx to be down to work (i.e: no port open on 80/443)
# - certbot automatically starts nginx after having generated certificates
#
# So we need to stop nginx, but not start it afterwards as it will
# fail. We ignore failures on stopped services in case we are messing
# around with nginx at the same time. This is a bit flaky.
